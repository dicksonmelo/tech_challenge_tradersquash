# Phoenix 1.6 Full-Stack Template

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Generate a guardian secret with `mix guardian.gen.secret`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Included
This template is a PETAL stack template. It is built on top of Pheonix

want, but the this setup has support to NPM or Yarn. Also we got: 

- TailwindCSS for styling
